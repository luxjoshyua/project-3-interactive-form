# FullStack JavaScript TechDegree
# Project 3: Interactive Form

* The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

* Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, we had to add our own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:
    * adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
    * validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

# Extra Credit Features (in progress...)
* T-Shirt colour label and menu are hidden until a design is selected from the 'Design' menu
* Real-time validation error messages provided for the following text fields:
    * Name
    * Email
    * Card Number
    * Zip Code
    * CVV

# Key learnings
* jQuery, and how to use it in collaboration with 'vanilla' JavaScript on the one project
* Switch functions
* Using regex through HTML
* The importance of declaring consts at the beginning of each function, in order to improve legibility
* Go back to the documentation! api.jquery and mdn, read thoroughly, read again and again and again and again!
